        <p>
            If you want to ask me to make something for you, here's how you can reach out. 
            <br>
            Step 1: Go to the socials tab in my portfolio.
            Step 2: Contact me via one of the platforms listed.
            Step 3: Let me know who you are, what you want me to create, and things like a deadline and things you want me to focus on.
            Step 4: We'll discuss the details such as pricing and project coordination.
        </p>
        <h1>Pricing</h1>
        <p> 
            Small projects: 
            Things like basic GUI work, basic map generation, NPC systems, debugging, or reworking parts of your game (this depends on complexity).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Medium projects: 
            Projects like inventory systems, basic quests, or medium-level features for your game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Large projects:
            More complex things like combat systems, combat AI, movement mechanics, or anything that's complex and takes a lot of time to complete.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Small Projects: Prices range from 100 Robux to $10 USD, depending on the complexity and time required. Medium Projects: Typically fall between $10 and $20 USD, with the final price based on the projectâ€™s complexity and time investment. Large Projects: Pricing depends on the scope of work. Full Game Development (Making a small game like a simulator for exapmle): Between $100 and $200 USD, depending on the size and features required. Individual Systems (e.g., combat systems): Between $25 and $35 USD.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Extra Info</h1>
        <p>I don't charge per hour because that would mean I would deliver your work quicker for less money. I just charge based on the size of the project itself; we discuss this during the project and before we start working together.</p>
        <p>If you have a passion project and you are in need of a scripter, I am willing to work for free with up to three people, depending on the amount of work you want me to do. This is a limited offer because, right now, I value gaining experience a lot more, and I genuinely enjoy creating projects together with people! Even if your project feels too large, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm open to discussing it because if I like the project myself, you'd be surprised by what I'm willing to do for you! And in case I do ask for money but I just like your project idea, there will be a price lowering for you.</p>
