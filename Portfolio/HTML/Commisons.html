    <main>
        <p>
            Thank you for considering me for your project! At the moment, I am not currently available for hire due to personal projects and skill development that I’m focused on. However, here’s some general information about how I usually approach commissions:
        </p>
        
        <h1>How to Reach Out (When I Am Available)</h1>
        <p> 
            1. Go to the "Socials" tab in my portfolio.  
            <br>
            2. Contact me through one of the platforms listed.
            <br>
            3. Let me know who you are, what you'd like me to build, and any details such as deadlines or specific features you want focused on.
            <br>
            4. We’ll discuss pricing, timeline, and the scope of the project before I start.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Services I Offer</h1>
        <p>
            I work with a variety of technologies and offer the following services:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Roblox Lua Development:</strong> Scripts, game mechanics, GUI systems, NPC systems, and more.</p>
        <p><strong>Unity Game Development:</strong> 2D and 3D game development, basic mechanics, player controls, UI elements, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Web Development:</strong>  web applications, front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) & back-end (Node.js, Express.js).</p>
        <p><strong>App Development:</strong> Mobile apps for basicly anything</p>

        <h1>Pricing</h1>
        <p>
            Pricing is based on the complexity of the project. Below is a rough guide:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Small Projects:</strong> Simple tasks like basic scripts, small game mechanics, basic website layouts, or app UI. Pricing depends on the complexity and scope of the work.</p>

        <p><strong>Medium Projects:</strong> More complex tasks like full game features, interactive websites, or app functionalities. Pricing depends on the specific features and time required.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Large Projects:</strong> Big game features, entire game development (e.g., a simple game like a simulator), web apps with multiple features, or full app projects. Pricing depends on the scope of work and overall complexity.</p>
        
        <h1>Additional Information</h1>
        <p>
            - I do not charge by the hour to ensure the project’s pricing remains clear and consistent. We’ll discuss the project’s scope beforehand, and the price will be agreed upon based on its complexity and time investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            - While I am primarily working on improving my skills at the moment, I am open to discussing smaller passion projects or collaborations with people who share the same enthusiasm for coding. However, please note that I am not actively taking on new work right now.
