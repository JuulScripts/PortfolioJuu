<h1>My Experience</h1>

<h1>Roblox Development</h1>
<p>
  I’ve made a lot of systems and game mechanics in Roblox Studio — from combat to procedural generation. While none of my projects have had an official release yet, I’m close to finishing a larger game focused on procedural tree generation and advanced data handling.
</p>

<h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>
  I’ve created a few private web apps for others. One freelance project — <em>[nda].website</em> — involved building a C# tool that uploads files to AWS and automatically updates the frontend so the client can manage the site themselves.
</p>
<p>
  As an honorable mention, I also developed a basic packet scanner in C#. It’s not very complex, and I don’t have a GitHub link for it, but it helped me understand network data handling better.
</p>
<p>
  I plan to add more public web work to my portfolio soon.
</p>

<h1>School Projects</h1>
<p>these arent my best projects but they do help you understand my learning speed because you can see improvement with time in C# practise. And these where all really easy and very effortless, i just made them to get the school work off my back so just bare mind that if i work for you you can expect MUCH more.</p>
<h1>My GitHub Projects</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JuulScripts/Text-based-adeventure-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Text-based Adventure Game</a></p>
<p>Simple console game, no extra notes.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JuulScripts/Tower-Defense-J_D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tower Defense (Unity Project)</a></p>
<p>Last Unity project I made for school, done in collaboration. Learned that branch naming should be descriptive (e.g., "movement" instead of "Juul/movement").</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JuulScripts/2d-adventure-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D Adventure Game</a></p>
<p>
  My first school project. I had a public API key in the repo, but I already knew not to keep keys client-side. It was kept that way just for ease of use while learning how to work with APIs in C#.
</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JuulScripts/Cplusplus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C++ Projects</a></p>
<p>My first C++ project</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JuulScripts/3d-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Game (Unity)</a></p>
<p>First Unity 3D project. A bit messy and rushed, but got an 80/100 (an A!) (which to be fair I got on all my projects). I'd organize it differently now.</p>

<p>
  I’ve created a few private web apps for others. One freelance project — <em>[nda].website</em> — involved building a C# tool that uploads files to AWS and automatically updates the frontend so the client can manage the site themselves. And of course some basic things with react and javascript etc, nothing special.
