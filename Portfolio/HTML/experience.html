        <h1>My Experience</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>
            I have 2 years of experience working with <strong>Roblox Studio</strong>, and I’m also a web developer. Currently, my focus is on front-end development, but I am continually expanding my skill set in various areas. As I grow, my portfolio will evolve to showcase these skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the moment, I’m looking to create games for people in <strong>Roblox Studio</strong>, focusing on creating functional and engaging game mechanics.
        </p>

        <h1>Current Projects</h1>
        
        <h1>Bones (React)</h1>
        <p>
            A non-profit app designed to help people quit addiction. It focuses on building the core features and user interface. Built using <strong>React</strong>, this project involves managing state, component logic, and integrating notifications for user engagement.
        </p>

        <h1>Roblox Game (Advanced)</h1>
        <p>
            A complex Roblox game project requiring careful handling of massive amounts of data and optimization for performance. The scale and depth of this project present a huge challenge, but it's a great addition to my portfolio as I work through complex game mechanics, data management, and optimization.
        </p>

        <h1>Website for a Client (C# and JavaScript)</h1>
        <p>
            I’m currently building a professional website with a local admin portal for content management. The back-end is powered by <strong>C#</strong>, and the front-end uses <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The website will allow the client to manage data, so ensuring security and usability is essential. Additionally, I’m using <strong>AWS</strong> for hosting and backend management.

        <h1>Future Projects</h1>
        
        <h1>Bones with Advanced Backend</h1>
        <p>
            After completing the client-side version of the Bones app, I plan to enhance its backend to handle more complex data and user interactions. The advanced backend will ensure data security and scalability for a better user experience.
        </p>

        <h1>Multiplayer Game from Scratch</h1>
        <p>
            One of my future goals is to develop a multiplayer game from scratch. This will involve server-client communication, player matchmaking, and synchronizing data across multiple players. It's a large challenge, but I'm excited to dive into this kind of project soon!
        </p>

        <h1>Examples of My Work</h1>
        <p>
            Below are some examples of my basic work in game development. These projects are intended to show the core functionality of different systems I’ve built, such as combat systems, inventory management, and teleportation.

        <p>
            I’ve also included some code snippets below to demonstrate the teleport system. These are a few screenshots showing the basic stages of development for the system.
