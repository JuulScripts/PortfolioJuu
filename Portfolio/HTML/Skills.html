        <p>
            I have about 2 years of experience working with <strong>Roblox Studio</strong> and <strong>Lua</strong>, where I've developed several small projects and features. My experience primarily includes creating combat modules, hitboxes, and related systems, but I’m also skilled in developing more complex features like inventory systems and other custom game mechanics.
        </p>

        <h1>Technologies & Languages</h1>
        <p>
            I have experience with the following technologies:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Roblox Studio & Lua</strong>: Creating game mechanics, combat systems, and GUI elements for Roblox games.</p>
        <p><strong>Unity (C#)</strong>: Developing basic 2D and 3D games, player controls, and game logic.</p>
        <p><strong>JavaScript & Node.js</strong>: Front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JS) and back-end with Node.js and Express.js.</p>
        <p><strong>React Native</strong>: Building mobile applications for iOS and Android.</p>

        <h1>Services I Offer</h1>
        <p>I can help with a variety of tasks and services, including:</p>
        <p><strong>Custom Combat Systems:</strong> I can create unique combat mechanics for your games, whether it’s for RPGs, action games, or other genres.</p>
        <p><strong>Client-side and Server-side Integration:</strong> Implementing systems such as inventory management, saving data, and synchronizing across the client and server.</p>
        <p><strong>Feature Development:</strong> Adding smaller features to your game, like money systems, map generation, NPC interactions, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> I’m happy to help with code you’re struggling with, debug issues, and optimize your existing systems.</p>
        <p><strong>AI Development:</strong> While I’m still learning AI for combat systems, I am capable of developing basic enemy AI and behaviors for your game.</p>

        <p>
            I’m always open to new challenges, so if you have a specific feature in mind, feel free to reach out, and we can discuss what I can do for you.
