            I have about 2 years of experience working with Roblox Studio and Lua, where I've built several small projects and features, i have mainly made things like combat modules, hitboxes and stuff like that though i can also make things like an inventory system.</p>  </p>
            <h1>Services</h1>
            <p>Services I offer:</p>
            
            <p>Basic custom combat systems.</p>
            
            <p>Client-side and server-side integration (e.g., sending inventory data back and forth).</p>
            
            <p>Feature development: I can make small things for your game, like money systems, map generation, etc.</p>
            
            <p>Bug fixes: I don’t only make things from scratch. I’m more than happy to help you with code you're struggling with. :D</p>
            
            <p>I can also make building systems, inventory systems, and that kind of stuff.</p>
            
            <p>AI: Though I do not have a lot of experience with making combat AIs, I am capable of doing it.</p>
