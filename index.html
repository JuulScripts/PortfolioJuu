    <h1>Hi, my name is Juliaan!</h1>
    <p>I’m an aspiring software developer/engineer with experience in multiple programming languages and frameworks. Over the past two years, I’ve developed projects using Roblox Studio with Lua, and I’ve also gained experience with JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, C#, Unity game engine, and a bit of Java though I only have a few weeks of experience with java, nothing major.</p>

    <p>I enjoy coding and collaborating with others. When working with people, I strive to deliver a high-quality product and ensure clear, concise communication. I value respect and open, honest communication in any project, so you can expect that from me if we work together.</p>
    
    <p>While I’m looking to earn some extra cash, my main focus is on learning and improving my skills, especially in handling clients and working collaboratively.</p>
    
    <p>If you need a Roblox Lua Developer, I’m available! I’m also constantly learning and expanding my skill set, so check back for more updates!</p>
    
    <h1>School</h1>
    <p>
        I am 15 years of age and I started programming at 13 (in roblox Studio).I recently started MBO 4 Software development because I have a passion for coding and I wanted to focus on it. I started in JanuarI and im allowed to do my internship in october (Im doing a sped up program.)
    </p>
    
<h1>Tools and Languages I Use or Have Used</h1>
<p><strong>Languages/Tools:</strong> Lua, Roblox Studio, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, basic C++, Node.js</p>
<p><strong>Frameworks/Technologies:</strong> Express.js (basics), AWS (for server-side work)</p>

<h1>Tools and Languages I'm Interested In</h1>
<p>
  I'm currently interested in learning PHP and SQL. I plan to explore them when im done with some of my current projects or when I have some free time on my hands, or sooner if they become necessary for an internship opportunity.
</p>

    
<h1>Unfinished Projects (Feel free to ask about them!)</h1>
<p>There’s a lot more I’m planning to build, but I’m focusing on finishing these three first. Starting too many things at once can lead to never finishing any of them ive made this mistake before and im not making it again.</p>


<p>[nda].website – This isn’t really my own project; it’s a freelance website I’m building for someone. I’ve created a C# console tool that uploads a file to AWS, which then updates the frontend so the client can manage the website himself.</p>

<p>Untitled tree game – A Roblox game using procedural generation and advanced data handling. The data handling isn’t strictly necessary for Roblox, but I’m including it to demonstrate my understanding of how structured data works. Once it’s finished, I’ll write a full page about it.</p>

<p>Custom file format – I’m planning my own file format. I already have it laid out, but I’d prefer not to share the details publicly until it’s ready.</p>
